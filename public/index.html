                            Tanım: Powder House Island (also known as Dynamite Island) is an artificial island on the
                            lower
                            Detroit River in southeast Michigan, directly adjacent to the Canada–United States border.
                            It
                            was constructed in the late 1880s by the Dunbar & Sullivan Company to manufacture and store
                            explosives during their dredging of the Livingstone Channel, in a successful attempt to
                            circumvent an 1880 court order forbidding the company from storing explosives on nearby Fox
                            Island. In 1906, twenty short tons (18,000 kg) of the island's dynamite exploded after two
                            men
                            "had been shooting with a revolver" near it. The explosion was clearly audible from 85 mi
                            (137
                            km) away. By the 1980s, it was completely unused; by 2015, the island was owned by the
                            Michigan
                            Department of Natural Resources, managed by its Wildlife Division as part of the Pointe
                            Mouillee
                            State Game Area, and accessible to the public for hunting and camping. (Full article...)
